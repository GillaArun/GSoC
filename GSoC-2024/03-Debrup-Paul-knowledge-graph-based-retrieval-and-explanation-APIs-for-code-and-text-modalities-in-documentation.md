### Work Summary


### What Was Covered
I focused on foundational research, experimentation, and the creation of modules related to Knowledge Graph creation, retrieval, and evaluation.

### What Is Left

From my side, all planned work is complete. However, this project has great future potential, and additional work can be pursued.
