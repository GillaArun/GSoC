# Project Abstract
As open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to gain popularity, their usability in projects like ours is increasingly evident. In this project, our goal is to develop a CyberSecurity News API tailored for automated bots on social media platforms, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. This cutting-edge Flask-based API offers seamless access to the latest cybersecurity and hacker news. Users can effortlessly retrieve news articles using specific keywords or without, streamlining the information acquisition process. Additionally, we aim to transition from closed LLMs to open-source ones, enhancing accessibility and transparency. To facilitate widespread testing, we'll also create a small UI for the API, allowing a larger audience to experience its functionality firsthand.
