### Introduction to the Project

In today's open-source ecosystem, a centralized and engaging platform to showcase key project information is crucial. This project aimed to create a website for C2SI that not only presents essential details but also offers a user-friendly experience. The core functionality includes displaying project information such as tech stacks, issue counts, contributor details, forks, and stars, while also highlighting individual contributions.

The frontend is built using Angular with TypeScript and SCSS, ensuring a scalable and responsive design. Angular’s robust framework and TypeScript’s static typing provide a solid foundation, while SCSS allows for a clean, adaptable design. On the backend, Node.js with Express is used to handle data efficiently, with the GitHub API ensuring real-time updates on project details. Databases are integrated for effective data management.

GitHub Actions have been implemented for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), automating the testing and deployment process to maintain code quality and efficiency. The goal was to create a comprehensive and visually appealing platform that supports C2SI's community and facilitates future contributions.

### Final Outcome

The project resulted in a fully functional and user-friendly website for C2SI ORG. It effectively displays detailed project information, including tech stacks, issue counts, contributor details, forks, and stars, while also showcasing individual contributions. The frontend, built with Angular, TypeScript, and SCSS, offers a responsive and visually appealing interface. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, ensures efficient data handling and API communication. GitHub API integration keeps project details up-to-date, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD streamline development. Overall, the website serves as a valuable resource for exploring, contributing to, and managing open-source projects under C2SI.
