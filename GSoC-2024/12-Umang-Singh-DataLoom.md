# DataLoom

## Project Abstract
Modern data analysis and manipulation tasks require robust and intuitive tools that can handle large volumes of data efficiently. Despite the powerful capabilities of the pandas library in Python for data manipulation, there's a significant barrier to entry for those without extensive programming experience. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that leverages pandas for data wrangling, making it accessible to a wider audience.

The project aims to create a web-based platform that provides a user-friendly interface for performing complex data manipulation tasks using pandas without the need for in-depth programming knowledge. This will democratize access to powerful data analysis tools, empowering users to perform their tasks more efficiently.

## What Covered
The DataLoom project has undergone substantial development, focusing on improving its functionality, usability, and deployment. Here's a summary of the key implementations:

1. **Menu and Table Features:** Implemented MenuNavbar for table navigation and added functional table components.

2. **Data Manipulation APIs:** Added APIs for filtering, sorting, and adding/removing rows and columns.

3. **Advanced Data APIs:** Implemented complex APIs for handling empty values, duplicate rows, advanced queries, and pivot tables.

4. **Dataset Management:** Added functionality for copying datasets, versioning, saving checkpoints, and reverting to previous states.

5. **Frontend and Backend Integration:** Completed integration between frontend and backend systems.

# What left

- User login and signup can be done.
- More Robust User experience can be made by removing more and more potential bugs
